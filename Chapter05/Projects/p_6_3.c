 * @copyright Copyright (c) 2022
 * 
 * Modify the broker program by making the following changes:
 * 
 *      a) Ask the user to enter the number of shares and the price per
 *          share, instead of the value of the trade.
 * 
 *      b) Add statements that compute the commission charged by a rival broker
 *          ($33 plus 3 cents per share for fewer than 2000 shares; $33 plus 2
 *          cents per share for 2000 shares or more). Display the rival's commission
 *          as well as the commission charged by the original broker.
