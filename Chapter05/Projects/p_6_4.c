 * Here's a simplified version of the Beaufort scale, which is used
 * to estimate wind force:
 * 
 *      Speed(knots)        Description
 *      Less than 1         Calm
 *      1 - 3               Light air
 *      4 - 27              Breeze
 *      28 - 47             Gale
 *      48 - 63             Storm
 *      Above 63            Hurricane
 * 
 * Write a program that asks the user to enter a wind speed (in knots),
 * then displays the corresponding description.
