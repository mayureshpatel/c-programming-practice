 * 
 * Write a program that reads an integer entered by the user and displays
 * it in octal (base 8):
 * 
 *  Input:
 *      Enter a number between 0 and 32767: 1953
 *  
 *  Output:
 *      In Octal, your number is: 03641
 * 
 * The output should be displayed using five digits, even if fewer digits
 * are sufficient. Hint: To convert the number to octal, first divide it
 * by 8. The remainder is the last digit of the octal number. Then divide
 * the original number by 8 and repeat the process to arrive
 * at the next-to-last digit.
 * 
 * NOTE: printf has a way to display octal numbers, which will be discussed
 * later.
